      Will ChatGPT replace human ?<br> A simple answer will be no .
      <p style="color:white">
        Lets understand from the core to get a clear idea , how ChatGPT can't replace human skills . 
      <p style="color:white">
      what is AI ?<br>
      AI can be divide into three 
      <ul>
      <li> Basic AI or Initial Stage AI </li>
      <li> Machine Learning </li>
      <li> Deep learning </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      So what comes in mind
       when you think of an ai , A humanoid robot or ChatGPT or  Dall-E  or Age of ultran , <br>
      we are intracting with AI for a long year , The chess game comes with windows XP or the card game , <br>
    </p>
      <h4>Initial Stage AI : </h4>
    <p>
      When we take a example of the game Chess :<br>
      Reaction of the computer will be programmed for a counter movement , when we reverse engineer the program , it will be If else and nested if else condition . In this
       case the computer can't learn new skills ( training  a moudle is not possible ) , so if we play with different format the computer will be defeted . <br>
      To solve the problem Machine learninga and Deep leaning is created . both have same working principal but the difference will be amount of data give to process and way of handeling it . 
    </p>
    <p> The main use case of ML and DL will be classification and Feature Extraction . </p>
    <h4>Machine Learning :
    </h4>
    <p>
      lets understand Machine leanrning will a example : <br>
      Best example for machine Learning will be object detection(feature extraction) and object recognition(classification) . when a object is given Ai will detect the object and find the object based on traind data set . 
    </p>
    <h4> Deep Learning:
    </h4>
    <p>
      Deep Leaning is used to get a more precise answer , which is capable of handeling large data set , Deep learning uses multi layer process using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks"> neural netwok  </a>  .<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/recurrent-neural-networks">RNN 
      </a>deep learning module is used to detect and recognize
       the object RNN stands for RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS . 
      <br>
       Deep leaning is evolved version of Machine learning .
    </p>
    <h4>How ChatGPT works:</h4>
    <p>
    ChatGPT is text based AI , which uses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing.</a>, NLP. is used in siri , google assistant , alexa to process the input give by human . NLP uses deep learning modules predict the output . NLP uses <a href="https://research.ibm.com/publications/transformer-based-neural-networks-capture-organic-chemistry-grammar-from-unsupervised-learning-of-chemical-reactions">Transformer nural network . </a>. <br>
    ChatGPT , GPT stands for GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMER . 
  </p>
  <h4>Will ChatGPT replce human skills ?</h4>
  <p>
    ChatGPT is main thread to prgrammers and content writers ,<br>
    content writes , writes web articles , scriptes . even chatGPT can write a script or article but it writes in the similar slang for all users . The unique writing skills makes the writer creative . ChatGPT can help content write by providing the content or synonyms of a word . so , ChatGPT can be used as a refernce .AI can't replace the unique writing style of a writer . <br>
    Programming :<br>
    there is meth that programmers just copy paste code from internet . well which is 100%
    wrong , simply compy past wont work to develp a project, of course code from the internet can be used for refernce but its not possible to finish the entire application . Building a frameowkr is most important . A framework will be choosen from the programmers point of view which is based on the application to be developed . UX and UI design will be decied the programmer not by a AI which gives similar layout for all users . 
    AI can be used as a tool
    to generate predefied syntax or functions like linking a database or joining a database . <br>
  </p>
<p>
    AI like ChatGPT will be awesome tool for engineers or physicist or to every profession . 

    So, 
    I conclude that AI can't replace human or humanskills !
